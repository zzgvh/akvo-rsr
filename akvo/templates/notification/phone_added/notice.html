<p>Your mobile number, {{phone_number}}, has been added to your user profile. This allows you to send updates to your projects via SMS.</p>

<p>To ensure that all works as it should we at Akvo ask that you validate the phone by sending in the following code:</p>

<p>{{validation}}</p>

<p>You should have recieved an SMS from us. Please reply to the SMS with a new one where you enter the validation code only and send it.
If all goes well you will recieve a new SMS confirming the registration. Then all you have to do is log in to Akvo and select the project you want to enable SMS updates for.</p>
